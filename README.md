# HTTPWebServer-Java
Project Description <br/>
For file requests, files are returned from the ‘www’ folder inside the project on GET request. For URI requests, ‘json’ content is returned as response based on the type of request. In this project, an API service for getting and deleting a list of ‘Messages’, which are statically created inside the project, is implemented.
